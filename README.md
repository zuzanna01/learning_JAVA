# JAVA mini programs

This repository is a collection of programs developed during my university class and covers a variety of topics in Java programming.

The programs are organized into separate directories, each containing a program focused on a specific topic like reading files or implementing basic threads.

All of the programs in this repository were developed using Java 17, and should be compatible with later versions of Java as well.
